To the Universe I don't mean a thing,
And there's just one word that I still believe,
and it's love.
</p>
<p>
-- Eddie Vedder, "Love Boat Captain"
</p>
</div>
	Humanity often tends to see itself as being somehow important in the grand 
scheme of the Universe.  
	We speak of "fate" as if we were put here for some reason, or perhaps 
<I>purpose</I>.  We have our religions, 
	which often serve as an engine to drive our lives and as a means to 
attribute meaning to them.  But 
	why do we think of ourselves in such a lofty fashion?  Do we really matter 
at all?  Would the Universe 
	give pause if we were suddenly plucked away?  In his short story, "The Open 
Boat," Stephen Crane shows
	us a Universe totally unconcerned with the affairs of humankind; it is an 
indifferent Universe in which 
	Man has to struggle to survive.  The characters in the story come face to 
face with this indifference 
	and are nearly overcome by  Nature's lack of concern.  They survive only 
through persistence and cooperation.  
	All we have, Crane asserts, in our constant struggle for survival, is 
stubborn pride--and each other.
</p>
<p>
	The story opens with four men, known simply as the captain, the oiler, the 
correspondent, and the cook, 
	stranded in the ocean in a small boat.  Crane's descriptions in these 
opening scenes show right away the 
	antagonism of the men and the sea and nature's lack of concern for their 
tragedy: "The birds sat comfortably 
	in groups, and they were envied by some in the dingey, for the wrath of the 
sea was no more to them than 
	it was to a covey of prairie chickens a thousand miles inland."  The men are 
in a desperate situation, but 
	nature continues in its ways regardless of what might happen to them.  The 
Sun continues to rise and set 
	everyday.  The shore is "lonely and indifferent."  They are even regarded by 
a shark, who apparently finds 
	no use for them.  The men, however, seem removed from the clockwork of their 
surroundings; seperate, but 
	somehow in the midst of everything happening around them. This indifference 
causes the men to feel a certain 
	alienation from nature.  They even go as far as to think of the Universe as 
being hostile:  "[The waves were] 
	nervously anxious to do something effective in the way of swamping boats."  
This is, however, just normal 
	activity of nature, not any act of agression against Man. 
</p>
<p>
	Although the men are pitted against an uncaring sea, they still at this 
point seem to think their destinies 
	are controlled by some outside force.  Their collective thoughts are given 
thus: "If I am going to be 
	drowned--if I am going to be drowned--if I am going to be drowned, why, in 
the name of the seven mad gods 
	who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and 
trees?...If this old ninny-woman, 
	Fate, cannot do better than this, she should be deprived of the managemant 
of men's fortunes."  It soon dawns 
	on them, though, that there is no "fate," no purpose for their being where 
they are.  It is the realization 
	of this fact that brings the men to the brink of despair:  "When it occurs 
to a man that nature does not 
	regard him as important, he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple, 
and he hates deeply the fact that 
	there are no bricks and no temples."  It seems to them that their situation 
is hopeless.  At one point, one 
	of the men asks the captain if he thinks they will make it, to which the 
captain replies "If this wind holds 
	and the boat don't swamp, we can't do much else."  Statements like these, 
along with Crane's journalistic prose, 
	show the futility that the men feel in the face of indifference, yet it also 
makes evident the fact that there 
	is still hope.
</p>
<p>
	What can Man do when faced with a Universe that has no sympathy for him?  
How can we survive alone against nature?  
	As the characters in the story come to realize, our only hope is in our 
sympathy and concern for other human beings.  
	The fact is most fully realized in the character of the correspondent.  
Crane tells us that he had been taught to be 
	cynical of men, but his shared tragedy with the other three men on the boat 
forced him to form a comradeship that 
	goes beyond mere associations.  As Crane tells us, "there was this 
comradeship that the correspondent, for instance, 
	who had been taught to be cyni cal of men, knew even at the time was the 
best experience of his life."  A metamorphosis 
	is undergone when he and the other men realize that all they have is each 
other.  The correspondent, recalling a 
	childhood verse, feels sympathy for a dying soldier, one who does not even 
exist: "The correspondent, plying the oars 
	and dreaming of the slow and slower movements of the lips of the soldier, 
was moved by a profound and perfectly 
	impersonal comprehension.  He was sorry for the soldier of the Legion who 
lay dying in Algiers."  Being in his current 
	situation, the correspondent can finally understand the pathos of the dying 
soldier.  He knows what it is like to be 
	alone in a cruel world, and more importantly, he realizes he doesn't have to 
be alone.  "It was no longer merely a 
	picture of a few throes in the breast of a poet, meanwhile drinking tea and 
warming his feet at the grate; it was an 
	actuality--stern, mournful, and fine."  He now understands what it is to be 
human: that constant striving in the face 
	of futility, and that need for others that ultimately none of us can deny.  
</p>
<p>
	Stephen Crane's "The Open Boat" gives us a dose of reality that at first 
seems bitter, but it gradually induces a 
	catharsis and in the end stands as testament to the human spirit.  His 
assertion that the Universe will never bend 
	to the will of man is outweighed by his reassurances that we will always 
have each other.  And when we contemplate 
	"a high cold star on a winter's night" we will not need to feel alone, 
because we can always turn to another person.
