<h1><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0395595118/wintermute/"><i>The Lord of the Rings</i></a>: A Myth for Modern Times</h1>
<h5>by <a href="/">Jason Voegele</a></h5>

<hr />
<p>
Many have questioned its viability as literature, without having read it. Many
critics have noted its use of the standard fantasy adventure formula, without
realizing that it <i>invented</i> the formula, that without this book writers
such as Terry Brooks, David Eddings, Robert Jordan, Tad Williams, and countless
hordes of others would be pursuing alternative careers. Many academics have
cried anathema over its marginal acceptance into their canon, without realizing
that Professor Tolkien of Oxford was One of Them, and worthy indeed of any
praise he may have received for the scholarly depth which characterizes his
work. Many children have enjoyed it over and over again, thus leading to the
common misperception that it is a children's book. Many have dismissed it as
fantasy, or allegory, or satire, or novelty, or social commentary, without
realizing that it is <em>Myth</em>. 
</p>
<p>
It is as myth that the novel succeeds where so many of the clones have failed.
In it: a world more thoroughly crafted and more fully-realized than any offered
by various cultures of the past; events with world-shaking consequences;
characters with real lives playing as pieces in a grand game. But what
distinguishes this book from its many imitators is its mythic grandeur, the epic
caliber of <em>story</em>, and its underlying vision of story as myth, and that
myth is truth. 
</p>
<p>
All this, and still amongst the most engrossing reads of the century.
