		Many have questioned its viability as literature, without having read it.
		Many critics have noted its use of the standard fantasy adventure formula,
		without realizing that it <em>invented</em> the formula, that without this book
		writers such as Terry Brooks, David Eddings, Robert Jordan, Tad Williams, and 
		countless hordes of others would be pursuing alternative careers.  Many academics
		have cried anathema over its marginal acceptance into their canon, without
		realizing that Professor Tolkien of Oxford was One of Them, and worthy indeed
		of any praise he may have received for the scholarly depth which characterizes
		his work.  Many children have enjoyed
		it over and over again, thus leading to the common misperception that it is
		a children's book. Many have dismissed it as fantasy, or allegory, or satire,
		or novelty, or social commentary, without realizing that it is <i>Myth</i>.
	<p>
		It is as myth that the novel succeeds where so many of the clones have failed.
