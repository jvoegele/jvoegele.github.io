<h3>"Carrion Comfort"</h3>
<h5>Gerard Manley Hopkins</h5>
<p class=verse>
	Not, I'll not, carrion comfort, Despair, not feast on thee;<br>
	Not untwist--slack they may be--these last strands of man<br>
	In me &oacute;r, most weary, cry <i>I can no more.</i> I can;<br>
	Can something, hope, wish day come, not choose not to be.<br>
	But ah, but O thou terrible, why wouldst thou rude on me<br>
	Thy wring-world right foot rock? lay a lionlimb against me? scan<br>
	With darksome devouring eyes my bruis&egrave;d bones? and fan,<br>
	O in turns of tempest, me heaped there; me frantic to avoid thee and flee?<br>
	<br>
	Why? That my chaff might fly; my grain lie, sheer and clear.<br>
	Nay in all that toil, that coil, since (seems) I kissed the rod,<br>
	Hand rather, my heart lo! lapped strength, stole joy, would laugh, ch&eacute;er.<br>
	Cheer whom though? the hero whose heaven-handling flung me, f&oacute;ot tr&oacute;d<br>
	Me? or me that fought him? O which one? is it each one? That night, that year<br>
	Of now done darkness I wretch lay wrestling with (my God!) my God.

	<p>
		Gerard Manley Hopkins was both a great poet and a Jesuit priest.  Religion influenced every
		aspect of his life, and many considered Hopkins the priest and Hopkins the poet to be one
		inseperable entity.  In some of his later poems, however, a dichotomy seemed to be developing
		between the two, with his poetry dealing with more earthly subjects than God and religion.
		But in "Carrion Comfort," a sonnet written in his waning years, he refutes the idea that his creative
		(i.e. poetic) self can exist without the spiritual inspiration emanating from his religious beliefs.
	</p>

	<p>
		His poem "Carrion Comfort" in particular seems to stress a self-doubt concerning how his poetry
		might affect his relationship with God.  In this poem Hopkins is faced with a decision concerning his 
		poetic imagination and its association with	his relationship with God. What is most interesting
		about this poem is that it not only serves as a key to understanding Hopkins' work, but it also
		appears to have been a cathartic experience for him.  The poem documents the changes that
		he 
		<p class=note>Provide more context for this quote. </p>
		He questions the purpose of his poetry, saying "Cheer whom though?  The hero whose heaven-handling 
		flung me, foot trod / Me? or me that fought him?"  
		<p class=note>Explain what you mean by "This very doubt".</p>
		This very doubt causes Hopkins much turmoil, but he won't allow himself to give in to the Despair,
		which he calls "carrion comfort."  He rejects this carrion comfort with what strength he has left
		in him: "Not, I'll not, carrion comfort, Despair, not feast on thee."  He has begun his journey
		into the unknown, facing that deep, futureless pit of despair, carrion comfort.
	</p>

	<p>
		Hopkins rejection of this despair allows him to reflect on his thoughts more clearly, and during
		the first stanza he is pondering his choices.  The language and dark imagery of this stanza reflect
		the confusion that Hopkins is facing: "cry <i>I can no more</i>.  I can; / Can something, hope
		wish day come, not choose not to be."
		<p class=note>Again, need more context for this quote.</p>
		It is as if he can do nothing until this decision is made.
		Amidst this confusion, he stops addressing carrion comfort and asks God directly why he is
		putting him through this turmoil.  It seems here that Hopkins' poetic side is coming through,
		for he portrays God as a terrible being, while he is fleeing in fear.  However, this representation
		of God is not mere poetic imagery, but a christian model of self-sacrifice.
		<p class= note>Explain connection between fear, fleeing, and self-sacrifice.</p>
		Hopkins is sacrificing his soul to God, and in the process clarifies his beliefs.
	</p>

	<p>
		With the beginning of the second stanza we see that Hopkins has made his decision.  The language
		has taken on greater clarity and he is answering the questions he raised.  He realizes now why
		God has put him to this test: "So that [his] chaff might fly; [his] grain lie, sheer and clear."
		He believes that he is now stronger in spirit due to the trial given him by God.  His image of God
		has also undergone a change--from vicious Judge and Punisher to kindly Chastiser.
		<p class=note>Explain the reference here.</p>
		Hopkins shows his gratitude for God's trial by saying "Nay in all that toil, that coil, since
		(seems) I kissed the rod, / Hand rather, my heart lo! lapped strength, stole joy, would
		laugh, cheer."
	</p>

	<p>
		Hopkins experience did more than create a poem, it changed him as a person.  His renewed
		relationship with God created for him a new way of viewing himself.  Thus we see that
		Hopkins held God in such reverence that that reverence was intrinsic in everything he did,
		most of all in his poetry.
		<p class=note>Expand upon this idea that the poem actually <i>does</i> something.</p>
	</p>

	<p>
		As God was three aspects in one, Gerard Manley Hopkins was two.  Hopkins the priest and
		Hopkins the poet, although one and the same, profoundly affected each other.  With one
		half missing, the other would die, but with both present they enhance each other's strengths.
		"Carrion Comfort" shows Hopkins realization of this fact and shows what the complete Hopkins
		could accomplish.
		<p class=note>Clean up this last paragraph.</p>
