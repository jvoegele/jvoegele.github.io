<h3 name=DEMOCRACY>The Democracy of Goods</h3>
	<p>
		The idea of "democracy of goods" is supposedly that anyone can afford such fine
		products as those that previously could be had only by the rich and priveleged.
		In advertisements that use this technique, whatever product being offered is
		portrayed as the product of choice for the "elite" of society, yet now it is
		miraculously available to everyone.  The problem inherent with this technique
		is that you can't really have a product so good that everyone wants it, and at
		the same time make it so cheap that everyone can afford it.  Due to the law of
		supply and demand, any such product would soon increase in cost until it is the
		very elitist product it's claiming not to be.  Consider a recent Subaru advertisement
		which claims that a Subaru is every bit as good a car as a Mercedes, yet at a
		more affordable price--a Mercedes for the "common man," it suggests.  The advertisement
		in question makes note of a <i>Car and Driver</i> review of the automobile:
		"The Subura Legacy is the nicest driving, least expensive, and best equipped
		4-wheel drive sedan on the market."  It seems Subaru is making an honest claim.
		<i>Car and Driver</i> supports their claim that their product is equal or
		superior to the competition.  So what is the problem?  The problem is that even
		the most affordable of 4-wheel drive sedans is out of the price-range of a
		sizable portion of our society.  The democracy of goods technique is one
		that is used to appeal to our sense of elitism and status while reminding us
		that <i>even we</i> are priveleged enough to obtain them.  Yet...most of these
		ads are aimed at the richer 50% of society anyway, serving only to further the gap
		between the rich and the poor.
	</p>


<h3 name=IDEALIZATION>Idealized Positive Associations</h3>
	<p>
		It is obvious that most advertisements do not accurately portray reality.  Very
		often they deal in idealizations and stereotypes that don't represent the diversity
		and flavor of real life.  This much is obvious.  Advertisers are often criticized
		for such use of stereotypes and idealizations in their advertisements.  Many people
		may object to beautiful models used to sell certain products, such as Claudia Schiffer
		for Guess? Jeans.  Would it be better, then, to use an unattractive, plump woman to
		try to sell this product.  Ethics aside, advertisers create ads to sell a product
		and use whatever methods they feel will be effective in persuading people to buy
		it.  The advertisers realize that Claudia Schiffer is going to convince a lot more
		people that Guess? Jeans are worth buying than, say, Granny Smith.  This technique
		is much more effective than most people care to admit.  Psychological studies have
		proven that, even if we are consciously aware that wearing Guess? Jeans will never
		make us look like Claudia Schiffer (or score a date with her), the positive associations
		created with the product actually do influence our desire to buy a product.  (Although
		see <a href="#SUBCULTURE">Exploitation of Subculture</a> for a possible counter-example).
	</p>
	<p>
		Like many other advertising techniques (perhaps <i>all</i> advertising techniques), use
		of such idealizations to create positive associations with a product may be viewed
		as exploitive.  Yet, to suggest that advertisers should not be allowed to use such
		techniques is to suggest censorship.  The point is not to disallow exploitive techniques.
		Rather, the point is to <i>recognize</i> such techniques as manipulative or exploitive.
		By understanding what these advertisements suggest, we can make more informed decisions...
		knowledge is power, I guess.

<h3 name=PARODY>Recursive Advertising and Parody</h3>
	<p>
		See my <a href="spoofads.html">essay</a> on this topic.
	</p>

<h3 name="SUBCULTURE">Exploitation of Subculture</h3>
	<p>
		Think <i>grunge</i>.  What started out as a musical movement evolved--much
		to the chagrin of the "leaders" of the grunge "movement", Nirvana, Pearl Jam,
		<i>et al</i>--to be a fashion advertisers dream.  Suddenly, a grubby corduroy
		jacket which Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder bought at a flea market for $10,
		could, through marketing's use of exploitation of subculture, be a $250
		fashion statement.  What's happening here?  Advertiser's have noticed a trend in
		fashion for some people to tend to dress like "bums."  They are trying to appeal
		to certain subcultures and their tastes in fashion.  Consider Calvin Klein's
		recent use of, well, less than attractive models.  One might think initially
		that Calvin Klein is initiating a positive trend in advertising by not limiting
		themselves to stereotypical notions of physical beauty.  But on further examination,
		one must realize that each of these non-standard models represents some minority group.

		
		Exaggeration?  This event actually took place, prompting
		Vedder to write the song <a href="corduroy.html">"Corduroy"</a> in response.
		The song contains the lines "They can buy, but can't put on, my clothes" and
		"Everything has changed...absolutely nothing's changed" which relate directly
		to the above-mentioned incident.
