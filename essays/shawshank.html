	<i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> presents us with the story of two men, Red Redding and Andy Dufresne, 
	serving life sentences at fictional Shawshank State Prison in Maine.  The film explores the 
	effects of long-term incarceration on the prisoners by discussing what it calls "institutionalization".  
	It shows us how the prison experience can grow on someone  until it is the only life one knows 
	and how he can begin to rely on the institution of the prison itself simply to remain who he is; 
	it "does [a] satisfying job of scouring the methods and madness of an ironclad institution, and 
	letting us look at inmates as if they were puppies lost in hell" (Stack 3c). But prison is just 
	one institution among the conglomerate of institutions that makes up the institution of our country, 
	and <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> suggests that this grand-scale institution can serve as a prison for 
	all of us; it can serve to institutionalize us as surely as Shawshank prison did its prisoners.
</p>
<p>
	At the beginning of the movie, Red Redding (the narrator of the film) is introduced to us as
	"the guy that can get it for you."  Inside Shawshank State Prison, Red is a very important man, at 
	least as far as the other prisoners are concerned.  His ability to get things for people has given 
	him a special status among the prisoners and he has grown used to his lifestyle within the walls of 
	the prison.  At one point in the film Red explains to Andy how he has become institutionalized:  
	"These walls are funny.  First you hate them, then you get used to them, until it gets to you depend 
	on them.  That's institutionalized."  Red's life has come to the point that his role inside the prison 
	is all that he knows; it defines his very being.  If this were taken away from him he would be unsure 
	of his role in society at large; he would no longer be the guy who can get things and his life would 
	have no meaning.
</p>
<p>
	Red's ideas about institutionalization are confirmed through the character Brooks, the prison librarian.  
	Brooks had been in prison for fifty years before finally being released on parole.  This time in prison 
	was certainly enough to "institutionalize" Brooks and for these fifty years he knew nothing other than 
	being the prison librarian.  So, when he is finally released, he does not know how to react.  His attempted 
	murder of a fellow inmate is an irrational act of desperation committed so that he will not have to leave 
	behind the only life he knows.  Brooks does eventually leave the prison behind, but what was meant to be a 
	grant of freedom is actually just a shift from one institution to another, one in which Brooks is out of place.  
	He lives alone and works at a grocery store for a callous, authoritarian manager.  (It is interesting to note 
	that <I>all</I> figures of authority are portrayed as callous and/or corrupted.  It is also interesting that they are 
	<I>all</I> white, male, and American).  Brooks' new life is no better than the one he had known in prison. It is, in 
	fact, much worse.  Brooks is "free", but what should Brooks do?  Brooks is no longer the prison librarian, the 
	role that had defined his life for <I>fifty years</I>.  Brooks no longer knows what (read 'who') he is.  
	Brooks hangs himself.
</p>
<p>
	As obvious as these effects of institutionalization are on  Red and Brooks, Andy Dufresne seems somehow immune 
	to them, as if "he wore an invisible coat that could shield him" from the prison.  Unlike the other prisoners at 
	Shawshank, Andy tries to maintain ties to his life outside the walls and simply refuses to resignedly accept 
	his role as a prisoner.  The "invisible coat" that Andy wears is hope.  "It is hope that allows the self-proclaimed 
	innocent man to survive what may or may not be an unjust imprisonment" (Turan f1).  It would appear that Andy 
	has been able to stave off the forces of the institution, to remain a free man in spirit if not in flesh.
</p>	
<p>
	If we were to consider only his experiences in prison, this would be absolutely true.  However, the movie gives 
	vital bits of information about Andy's life outside of prison.  In his former life, Andy was a banker-- an 
	"institutional" job if there ever was one.  He was introverted and uptight.  Andy feels that this was responsible 
	for the death of his wife--the wife he was convicted of murdering.  As he explains to Red, Andy's wife thought of 
	him as a "closed book" that was so caught up in his work that he was incapable of loving her, and this he believes 
	lead to the liaison that ended in her death.  Andy is the product of a society that stresses hard work and 
	dedication to ascribed statuses.
</p>
<p>
	Oddly enough, Andy's imprisonment can be seen as a liberating force in his life. It allowed (in the loosest sense 
	of the word) him a way out of his previous role, and his refusal to accept the one being forced upon him has 
	granted him a spiritual freedom unattainable to any institutional man.  And his eventual escape from prison would 
	seem the logical conclusion of the story.  But the fact that Red is our narrator suggests that this is his story too.  
	Red is admittedly an institutional man and his eventual release from prison into a society that has no use for "a guy 
	that can get things" ("Out there...you can use the Yellow Pages") comes only when he demonstrates to the parole 
	board that he is indeed "rehabilitated".  Rehabilitated, of course meaning resigned, hopeless, and defeated--"ready 
	to rejoin society".  In a word, institutionalized.  After this release, Red's life in a society  he does not know is similar 
	to that of Brooks; he has merely switched to a larger institution in which he is not important.  He is unhappy and 
	fears he may meet the same sad demise that Brooks did.  This fear continues until one day Red finds, hidden within 
	"a rock wall, right out of a Robert Frost poem", a box left by Andy.  Andy's Box that was, after all the evils and 
	miseries of the world had fled out to afflict mankind, filled with hope.  (The Pandora theme is a recurring one
	throughout the film).
	<!--(sounds familiar; might it be more than coincidence? Andy...Pandora...well, it could be!)-->
	Hope, that is, in the form of "twenty new fifty-dollar bills."   
	With this money, Red is able to join Andy where they can both be free from the shackles of society: Zihuatanejo, Mexico.  
	If it exists at all it is too obscure to appear even on a regional map of Mexico.  This could be seen as an inspirational 
	statement that "hope, trust, and friendship are among the most powerful of human values" (Sterritt14:2).  More likely 
	it is a cynical one.  Andy and Red are trapped in their roles in society, and (like Deckard and Rachael in <I>Bladerunner)</I> 
	there is nowhere for them to go--except perhaps this tiny little town in Mexico bordering on the Pacific...<I>if</I> you have 
	the means to get there, the money and skills to make it on your own, <I>if</I> you've served your time.
</p>
<p>
	Does this mean that we are all victims of institutionalization in our society?  Perhaps, perhaps not, but <i>The Shawshank 
	Redemption</i> certainly suggests that this could be.  After all, how do we define who we are?  Who is Ursula LeGuin?  
	She's a writer.  Who is Andy Dufresne?  Well, he was a banker, but now he's a prisoner.  So, are we all doomed to 
	institutionalism?  Maybe, but like Andy Dufresne, we can always hope.
