	The Holocaust is a difficult topic to deal with as subject matter for a work of art; 
	its horrors have been explicitly brought to light countless times in several different 
	formats and knowledge of these horrors has pervaded our society such that nearly everyone 
	has been exposed to them in some way or another.  In order to tell an effective story 
	about the Holocaust, one must do more than shock the reader with the evils that took 
	place in concentration camps or Jewish ghettos--this has been done once and for all by 
	those who lived through it.  In his book <i>Schindler's List</i>, novelist and playwright Thomas 
	Keneally goes beyond such shock value by telling of the profound goodness that emerged--from 
	such unspeakable evil--in the character of prison camp <I>Direktor</I> Oskar Schindler and his 
	<I>Schindlerjuden.</I>	
</p>
<p>
	<i>Schindler's List</i>, although based on the true story of the events surrounding Oskar Schindler's 
	life during World War II--primarily how he came to save more than 1,100 Jews from the gas 
	chambers by employing them in his factory--is  technically a novel.  However, the work is not 
	fiction.  As Keneally explains in his author's note, "fiction would debase the record...and 
	I have attempted to distinguish between reality and myths that are likely to attach themselves 
	to a man of Oskar's stature...most exchanges and conversations, and all events, are based on the 
	detailed recollections of the <I>Schindlerjuden</I> (Schindler's Jews), of Schindler himself, and of other 
	witnesses to Oskar's acts of outrageous rescue."  In his telling of the story, Keneally's sure-handed 
	prose adds credibility and its occasional delve into the poetic adds great emotional weight.  The 
	effect of such a telling is that of a slow toxin that siezes the reader by the heart and squeezes 
	to the point of anguish, leading to a novel that is both deeply moving and absolutely believable.
</p>
<p>
	As for the story itself, Keneally focuses mostly on the actions and ambitions of Schindler, leaving 
	the horror stories recessed in the background, creeping around the edges.  When such evils are 
	brought to the forefront of the tale, they are potent and real, but somehow serve more as chiaroscuro 
	to the divine goodness of Schindler's deeds.  Thus it is that much more effective when Schindler 
	spends every bit of his entire life's fortune to literally buy life for as many of the Jews as he 
	possibly can.  When all is said and done, Keneally has done no less than consecrate the sanctity of 
	life by weighing its importance against that of essentially meaningless things such as money.
</p>
<p>
	<i>Schindler's List</i>, by telling the story of a good man living in such evil times, has become an important 
	addition to Holocaust literature.  In showing what Schindler did--against all odds, perhaps even considered 
	crimes against "humanity" (at least blond-haired blue-eyed humanity) by his "superiors"--Thomas Keneally 
	has shown us that one man can make a difference.  Amazing to think what could be done if we all worked together.
