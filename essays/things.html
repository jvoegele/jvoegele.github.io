In his story "The Things They Carried," Tim O'Brien describes a group of 
soldiers marching 
through Vietnam. He does this by describing the items that each of them 
carries with him 
during the march. The things that the soldiers carry with them are both 
tangible and intangible 
items and what these things are depends upon the individual soldier. They 
carry the basic "necessities" 
for survival (if one can consider such things as M&amp;M's a necessity) and 
the bare minimum to make 
life as livable as possible. But they also carry memories, and fears, and it 
is intangible items like 
these that are the prime focus of the story. The weight of these abstract 
items is as real as that of 
any physical ones, and unlike those physical objects, they are not so easily 
cast away.
</p>
<p>
	Throughout the story, O'Brien alternates between narrative passages and 
simple descriptions of the items 
	that the soldiers are carrying. This fragmentation brings focus to the 
things the men are carrying, both 
	tangible and intangible, without downplaying the narration. In the 
descriptive segments of the story, 
	O'Brien is very exact in his descriptions and seems to be merely cataloging 
what is being carried: "As a 
	first lieutenant and platoon leader, Jimmy Cross carried a compass, maps, 
code books, binoculars, and a 
	.45(c)caliber pistol that weighed 2.9 pounds full loaded." O'Brien gives 
only straight forward descriptions 
	in these segments and the writing is void of any feeling or sentiment. When 
describing the intangible things, 
	however, the writing is a lot more in tune with the emotions of the 
characters: "Jimmy Cross humped his 
	love for Martha up the hills and through the swamps...Lieutenant Cross 
remembered touching [her] left knee. 
	A dark theater, he remembered,...when he touched her knee, she turned and 
looked at him in a sad, sober way 
	that made him pull his hand back, but he would always remember." O'Brien's 
writing takes on more sentimentality 
	in these sections and adds a great deal of emotional weight for the reader. 
This contrast in narrative style 
	is necessary to give emphasis to the intangible things that the men carried.
</p>
<p>
	One thing O'Brien does frequently in describing the items is to tell how 
much it weighs. "The weapon weighed 
	7.5 pounds unloaded, 8.2 pounds with its full 20 round magazine. The 
riflemen carried anywhere from 12 to 20 
	magazines...adding on another 8.4 pounds at minimum, 14 pounds at maximum." 
This gives the reader a sense 
	of the burden that the men are bearing in carrying these things. Much 
attention is given to the weight and 
	pressure the soldiers feel from what they're carrying and from external 
forces, such as nature. "They carried 
	the sky. The whole atmosphere...they carried gravity." But the greatest 
weight the men feel comes from nothing 
	they can physically carry, but rather their emotions: "Grief, terror, love, 
longing these were intangibles, but 
	the intangibles had their own mass and specific gravity, they had tangible 
weight."
</p>
<p>
	These emotional burdens are the heaviest because they are intangibles and 
therefore cannot be disposed of. 
	Physical burdens are no more than that; if necessary they can be discarded. 
Emotional burdens, on the other hand, 
	must be endured. O'Brien, speaking of cowardice in particular, says, "in 
many respects this was the heaviest 
	burden of all, for it could never be put down." The soldiers know there is 
no easy way to rid themselves of 
	their fears because of their abstract nature, but they dream escapist dreams 
of flying away in a plane and 
	"falling higher and higher," free of weight. Jimmy Cross tries to rid 
himself of intangible burdens by disposing 
	of tangible ones that, to him, represent intangible qualities. He does this 
by burning his letters from Martha. 
	He knows, though, that this simple act cannot rid him of his memories. "He 
realized it was only a gesture...Besides, 
	the letters were in his head." His love for Martha is also represented by 
the small pebble, which she gave him, 
	but the easily disposable pebble, which weighs merely an ounce, represents a 
much heavier emotional burden that 
	he cannot rid himself of.
</p>
<p>
	Cross attempts this to try to better himself as a soldier, but O'Brien 
leaves it up in the air as to whether he 
	accomplishes this. We can infer, however, from earlier statements that he 
will never be completely freed from the 
	love he carries. The soldiers in "The Things They Carried" carried many 
things with them on their march. All of 
	the things they carried were a great burden, but none more so than their 
emotions. All of them carry great loads 
	of memories, fears, and desires. These intangible objects are an essential 
part of them and therefore cannot be 
	put down, but carried and endured. And as Jimmy Cross comes to realize, "It 
was very sad...the things men carried 
	inside."
