		These are some essays and short opinion pieces I've written over the years,
		most of them for college courses.  I once held the delusion that I was a
		Writer, but I've since reread my work and decided that I tend to <i><b>OVERSTATE
		MY ASSERTIONS</b></i>.  Oh well, I still feel that there's some good material
		in these essays, and I learned a lot writing them so all was not wasted.
		Those with an interest in semiotics might enjoy these pieces, although
		they might be most useful to college students with a looming deadline.
		Please note, however, that all materials are copyright &copy; Jason Voegele,

	<ul>
		<li>
			<h4><a href="jeremy.html">Jeremy: A Modern-Day Richard Cory</a></h4>
			This is an essay about the video for Pearl Jam's "Jeremy".  It analyzes
			the role of the "traditional family values" myth from the perspective
			of the outcast and discusses the dangers of believing in such myths.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4><a href="spoofads.html">Recursive Advertising: The Joke's on Us</a></h4>
			This essay discusses the popular parody trend in advertising and manipulation
			of consumer desires by such advertisements. Do you remember the old Bud Light
			ad that had men dressed as women so they could score free beer on ladies night?
			It was funny, right? Sure, just be wary.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4><a href="shawshank.html"><i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>: Prison U.S.A.</a></h4>
			I've never thought that <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> was a perfect movie,
			but from a thematic standpoint it has a lot to say about life as one giant
			institution. Do you have bars on your windows?
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4><a href="faulkner.html">Thought and Language</a></h4>
			An essay evauluating William Faulkner's use of stream-of-consciousness
			in <i>As I Lay Dying</i>, and how language, as a medium for expressing
			thought, is inherently limiting to such works.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4><a href="schindler.html">Some Thoughts on <i>Schindler's List</i>, the Novel</a></h4>
			This is a short review of the novel <i>Schindler's List</i> by Thomas Keneally,
			which was of course the seed for Stephen Spielberg's miraculous film.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4><a href="openboat.html">Naturalism in "The Open Boat"</a></h4>
			A short essay on Stephen Crane's "The Open Boat" which offers the rather
			grim perspective that we're no more than flakes of cosmic dust in an
			utterly indifferent universe.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4><a href="things.html">Thoughts on "The Things They Carried"</a></h4>
			Another short discussing Tim O'Brien's story "The Things They Carried".
			An excellent story about emotional weight and transcendence.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4><a href="/literarysf/bladerunner.html">Thoughts on <i>Blade Runner</i></a></h4>
			A brief exploration of the wavering boundary between reality and perception,
			as evidenced in the film <i>Blade Runner</i>, directed by Ridley Scott,
			and based on the novel <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i> by
			Philip K. Dick.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4><a href="hopkins.html">Hopkins: Priest and Poet</a></h4>
			A work in progress regarding the role of religion in the poetry
			of Gerard Manley Hopkins, with a particular focus on his poem
			"Carrion Comfort".
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Science Fiction fans might also be interested in the <a href="../literarysf/journal.html">
		essays and journals</a> I've written on several SF topics for the
		<a href="../literarysf/">Literary Science Fiction</a> homepage.
