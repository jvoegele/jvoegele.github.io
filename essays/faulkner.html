	Human thought often does not take the form of language.  People think without words
	and the mind works with concepts instead of words.  Language, on the other hand, is
	a means of expressing these thoughts.  When we hear the word "dog" we think of the four-legged,
	furry thing that makes the sound we call "bark."  But what do we think when we hear a word
	like "love," or any other word representing an abstract concept?  Here the use of language as
	a medium for expression of thought begins to break down.  This is the problem faced by a writer
	like Willam Faulkner, who uses a stream-of-consciousness technique, which attempts to simulate
	pure thought patterns directly in language.  How can a book, whose only possible means of expressing
	an idea is through the use of language, express "pure thought," where language is usually absent?
	In <i>As I Lay Dying</i>, Faulkner disembodies the language from his characters in order to create
	the thoughts and ideas of the characters in the readers mind.
</p>
<p>
	Faulkner's use of the stream-of-consciousness in this book forces him to resolve the problem
	of language being an imperfect conveyance of thought.  what he does to overcome this problem
	is to withdraw the language from the character.  He uses his own language which can then
	create these thought's in the mind of the reader.  We know the language isn't coming directly
	from the characters because their narrations use much more complex vocabulary and syntax
	than does their speech.  Therefore, Faulkner must be applying the language, choosing <i>his</i>
	own words, to express what the characters are thinking.  Thus, we get a first-person narration
	once removed, and we receive the thoughts and ideas of the narrator through the filter of the
	author's language.
</p>
<p>
	Language's most limited form of expression manifests itself in the character of Vardaman,
	a young child.  Vardaman's ability to use language has not yet fully developed.  And although
	his thoughts may be somewhat simpler than those of an adult, they are no less difficult to express
	in language.  Since Vardaman's use of language is so limited, Faulkner applies words to his thoughts,
	words theat create in the reader's mind the toughts and impressions that are in Vardaman's.  For example,
	Vardaman is in a stall with a horse, and his perceptions of this horse and his surroundings are written thus:
</p>
<blockquote><b>
	It is as though the dark were resolving him out of his integrity, into an unrelated scattering
	of components--snuffings and stampings; smells of cooling flesh and ammoniac hair; an
	illusion of a coordinated whole...whithin which,...an <em>is</em> different from my <em>is</em>.
</b></blockquote>
<p>
	Obviously a child as young as Vardaman is incapable of talking, or thinking, in this manner.
	However, these are Vardaman's perceptions, not his words; those are Faulkner's.  Vardaman
	smells a distinct scent, and his brain registers it.  Faulkner then takes this distinct scent
	and applies to it a word with which the reacer can identify as that certain smell.  In this way,
	the reader can experience what Vardaman does.
</p>
<p>
	This limitation in expression causes the use of abnormal (sometimes nonexistent) words and
	structure.  So, when a character's thoughts are of an abstract nature, Faulkner uses
	language that would convey that thought to the reader, even if it is not the normal way
	one would express it.  When Darl, who is the narrator of many chapters in the book, hears
	the sound of an axe striking wood, then, his thoughts are not recorded as "The sound of an
	axe striking wood."  Rather, Faulkner conveys this idea by giving us language (onomatopoeia in 
	this case) that we can interpret as this sound.  Darl says (thinks, rather):
</p>
<blockquote><b>
	I go on to the house followed by the
	<blockquote>Chuck.  Chuck.  Chuck.</blockquote>
	of the adze.
</b></blockquote>
<p>
	Obviously Darl is not thinking the word "chuck" every time the axe strikes, but Faulkner is
	applying words which stem from Darl's thoughts so that they can be conveyed more directly
	to the reader.
</p>
<p>
	Even with these techniques, Faulkner's use of language for expression sometimes goes
	beyond the scope of what words can express.  In these instances, the idea is usually related
	to some other concept for which we have a word.  But if Faulkner is to stay true to the
	pattern of thought of his characters, he cannot use comparisons to express the idea.
	Instead, he often uses words that don't exist in any technical sense, but are comprehendible
	to the reader by virtue of their similarity to other words or phrases.  In one instance,
	Addie says "It was not that I could think of myself as no longer unvirgin, because I was
	three now."  The word "unvirgin" is essentially meaningless from the standpoint of everyday
	usage of language; it does not exist.  However, we can all understand what it is Addie is thinking
	when she says this because this word is similar or related to words representing the same, or similar,
	concepts.  The reason Faulkner uses this invented word rather than a similar pre-existent one is that
	this word expresses the concept most directly and follows the thought patterns of this character
	most closely.
</p>
<p>
	In spite of the obvious limitations of language, thought often does take the form of words.
	It is in these instances that the reader comes closest to the mind of the character; in other words,
	the words seem to be emanating from the character, rather than being the writer's interpretation of
	his or her thoughts.  This would explain the frequent use of colloquial diction in the book.
	But this seemingly direct conveyance of thought is actually merely an interpretation.  When Jewel
	says, "It's because he stays out there, right under the window, hammering and sawing on that 
	goddamn box," he isn't really thinking each word, individually, in his head, but he is conceiving
	the concepts that these words represent.  In this case, the language comes closer to being a "thought,"
	but remains detached from it.
</p>
<p>
	Even with disembodied language, language which is separated from the character's thoughts but
	still represents the ideas, it is sometimes impossible to express a concept in words.  People
	are capable of formulating thoughts beyond what words allow them the power to express.  Expression
	of these particular concepts in words can be achieved only with the use of similes or metaphors:
	saying this idea is like this... Comparisons, however, fail to convey the exact idea; this gap
	cannot be overcome.  Even giving credence to the idea that thoughts themselves are essentially
	<i>inexact</i>, begs the question fo whether words and language are capable of expressing them fully.
	Since metaphors can't be used to express an exact thought of a character, this thought must be
	<i>represented</i>, if not expressed directly, some other way.  This problem is faced by Faulkner
	when one of his characters, Tull, is thinking of a shape which has no pre-defined name.  He says
	"Cash made it clockshape...", but this metaphoric description fails to create a picture for the
	reader, so the narration continues "...like this 
	<img src="clock.gif" alt="Clock Shape" align=middle>."
	<p class=note>NOTE: This image has been botched.  I'll soon replace it with one that shows
	more clearly the shape in question.</p>
	<p>
	This allows Faulkner
	to portray exactly what his character is thinking.  Tull forms this image in his mind, and so that
	we can see his thoughts more directly, Faulkner allows us to envision this shape by use of a
	drawn image.
</p>
<p>
	A book's restriction to words hampers somewhat its ability to express thoughts and ideas.  In
	<i>As I Lay Dying</i>, William Faulkner overcomes this limitation by disembodying the language
	from his characters.  In this way, he can express directly what his characters are thinking
	while still following the patterns of their thoughts.  This technique has allowed his novel
	to beyond the boundaries of words into the realm of ideas.
