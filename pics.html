		This was in New York city, where Doug (right), Mike (left),
		and I (middle) went to see Pearl Jam in concert at Madison
		Square Garden.  As you can see, I'm sporting the new Pearl
		Jam tee the day after the show.  We're atop the World Trade
		Center, and that's the Empire State Building in the distant
		background.  We didn't intend to catch the old man's posterior
		in the picture.  It's not the most sightly landmark, and we're
		not dishing out any royalties.
