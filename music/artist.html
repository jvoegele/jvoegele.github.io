<p>
This is Pearl Jam's first release, and it shows to some degree.  Still, back in the early '90's,
when we just starting to realize how <em>bad</em> music had been for the past decade and a half,
it came as a welcome relief: music that was full of heart and soul, that tried to make a
difference, and though not as important in this regard as Nirvana's <cite>Nevermind</cite>,
started something fresh and new.
</p>
<p>
Pearl Jam has certainly went on to produce work that was more sophistocated and in many regards
<em>better</em> than this, their first album.  But they've never quite struck a chord as much
as they did when <i>Evenflow</i>, <i>Alive</i>, <i>Jeremy</i>, and <i>Black</i> were ruling the
charts.
