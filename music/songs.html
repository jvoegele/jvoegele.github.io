	<h3>"Find the River", R.E.M. <i>Automatic for the People</i></h3>
	<img src="images/cover_automatic_for_the_people.gif" align=right width=301 height=300>
	<p class=verse>
		Hey now, little speedyhead,<BR>
		the read on the speedmeter says<BR>
		you have to go to task in the city<BR>
		where people drown and people serve.<BR>
		Don't be shy.  Your just deserve<BR>
		is only just light years to go.<BR>
		<BR>
		Me, my thoughts are flower strewn<BR>
		ocean storm, bayberry moon.<BR>
		I have got to leave to find my way.<BR>
		Watch the road and memorize<BR>
		this life that pass before my eyes.<BR>
		Nothing is going my way.<BR>
		<BR>
		The ocean is the river's goal,<BR>
		a need to leave the water knows<BR>
		We're closer now than light years to go.<BR>
		<BR>
		I have got to find the river,<BR>
		bergamot and vetiver<BR>
		run through my head and fall away.<BR>
		Leave the road and memorize<BR>
		this life that pass before my eyes.<BR>
		Nothing is going my way.<BR>
		<BR>
		There's no one left to take the lead,<BR>
		but I tell you and you can see<BR>
		we're closer now than light years to go.<BR>
		Pick up here and chase the ride.<BR>
		The river empties to the tide.<BR>
		Fall into the ocean.<BR>
		<BR>
		The river to the ocean goes,<BR>
		a fortune for the undertow.<BR>
		None of this is going my way.<BR>
		There is nothing left to throw<BR>
		of Ginger, lemon, indigo,<BR>
		coriander stem and rose of hay.<BR>
		Strength and courage overrides<BR>
		the privileged and weary eyes<BR>
		of river poet search naivete.<BR>
		Pick up here and chase the ride.<BR>
		The river empties to the tide.<BR>
		All of this is coming your way.<BR>

	<h3>"Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town", Pearl Jam <i>Vs.</i></h3>
	<img src="images/cover_pj_vs.gif" align=right width=301 height=300>
	<p class=verse>
		I seem to recognize your face.<BR>
		Haunting, familiar yet I can't seem to place it.<BR>
		Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name.<BR>
		Lifetimes are catching up with me.<BR>
		All these changes taking place,<BR>
		I wish I'd seen the place<BR>
		But no one's ever taken me.<BR>
		Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away (x2)<BR>
		I swear I recognize your breath.<BR>
		Memories like fingerprints are slowly raising.<BR>
		Me you wouldn't recall for I'm not my former;<BR>
		It's hard when your stuck upon the shelf.<BR>
		I changed by not changing at all.<BR>
		Small town predicts my fate.<BR>
		Perhaps that's what no one wants to see.<BR>
		I just want to scream "Hello".<BR>
		My god its been so long never dreamed you'd return,<BR>
		But now here you are and here I am...<BR>
		Hearts and thoughts they fade away<BR>
		Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away (x2)<BR>
		Hearts and thoughts they fade away yea<BR>
		Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away (x3)<BR>
		Hearts and thoughts they fade<BR>

	<h3>"Given to Fly", Pearl Jam <i>Yield</i></h3>
	<img src="images/cover_pj_yield.gif" align=right width=301 height=300>
	<p class=verse>
		He could've tuned in, tuned in but he tuned out<br>
		A bad time nothing could save him<br>
		Alone in a corridor waiting locked out<br>
		He got up out of there ran for hundreds of miles<br>
		He made it to the ocean had a smoke in a tree<br>
		The wind rose up set him down on his knee<br>
		<br>
		A wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw<br>
		Delivered him wings "Hey, look at me now..."<br>
		Arms wide open with the sea as his floor<br>
		Oh, oh oh... he's flying! High! Wide!<br>
		<br>
		He floated back down 'cause he wanted to share<br>
		His key to the locks on the chains he saw everywhere<br>
		But first he was stripped, and then he was stabbed<br>
		By faceless men, well fuckers...he still stands<br>
		<br>
		And he still gives his love, he just gives it away<br>
		The love he receives is the love that is saved<br>
		And sometimes is seen in a strange spot in the sky<br>
		A human being that was given to fly...

	<p class=verse>
		What else should I be?<br>
		All apologies.<br>
		What else could I say?<br>
		Everyone is gay.<br>
		What else could I write?<br>
		I don't have the right.<br>
		What else should I be?<br>
		All apologies.<br>
		<br>
		In the sun<br>
		In the sun I feel as one<br>
		In the sun<br>
		In the sun<br>
		Im married<br>
		Buried<br>
		<br>
		I wish I was like you,<br>
		Easily amused.<br>
		Find my nest of salt,<br>
		Everything is my fault.<br>
		I'll take all the blame,<br>
		Aqua seafoam shame.<br>
		Sunburn with freezer burn.<br>
		Choking on the ashes of her enemy.<br>
		<br>
		In the sun<br>
		In the sun I feel as one<br>
		In the sun<br>
		In the sun<br>
		Im married<br>
		Buried<br>
		Married<br>
		Buried<br>
		All in all is all we all are<br>
		All in all is all we all are<br>
		All in all is all we all are<br>
		All in all is all we all are<br>
		All in all is all we all are<br>
		All in all is all we all are<br>
		All in all is all we all are<br>
		All in all is all we all are<br>

	<h3>"Mayonaise", Smashing Pumpkins <i>Siamese Dream</i></h3>
	<img src="images/cover_siamese_dream.gif" align=right width=301 height=300>
	<p class=verse>
		Fool enough to almost be it <BR>
		Cool enough to not quite see it <BR>
		Doomed <BR>
		Pick your pockets full of sorrow <BR>
		And run away with me tomorrow <BR>
		June <BR>
		<BR>
		We'll try and ease the pain <BR>
		But somehow we'll feel the same <BR>
		Well, no one knows <BR>
		Where our secrets go <BR>
		<BR>
		I send a heart to all my dearies <BR>
		When your life is so, so dreary <BR>
		Dream <BR>
		I'm rumored to the straight and narrow <BR>
		While the harlots of my perils <BR>
		Scream <BR>
		<BR>
		And I fail <BR>
		But when I can, I will <BR>
		Try to understand <BR>
		That when I can, I will <BR>
		<BR>
		Mother weep the years I'm missing <BR>
		All our time can't be given <BR>
		Back <BR>
		Shut my mouth and strike the demons <BR>
		That cursed you and your reasons <BR>
		Out of hand and out of season <BR>
		Out of love and out of feeling <BR>
		So bad <BR>
		<BR>
		When I can, I will <BR>
		Words defy the plans <BR>
		When I can, I will <BR>
		<BR>
		Fool enough to almost be it <BR>
		And cool enough to not quite see it <BR>
		And old enough to always feel this <BR>
		Always old, I'll always feel this <BR>
		<BR>
		No more promise no more sorrow <BR>
		No longer will I follow <BR>
		Can anybody hear me <BR>
		<em>I just want to be me!</em><BR>
		When I can, I will <BR>
		Try to understand <BR>
		That when I can, I will <BR>
		<BR>
