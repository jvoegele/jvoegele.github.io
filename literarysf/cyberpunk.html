	I think William Gibson is probably the best pure <I>writer</I> that I have read for years.  
	I don't think, on the other hand, that his <I>fiction</I> is the best that SF has produced--but
	his deliverance of the stories is his strong
	point.  His prose has been polished to the point that it sparkles and contains more than a 
	good deal of poetry.  Not only is his language poetic, but also are his images, especially
	his depiction of cyberspace with all its colorful towers of data.	
</p>
<p>
	As far as Gibson's fiction is concerned it is always interesting, often relevant, and on 
	occasion cathartic.  Most of his stories seem to take on the same sort of tone, that stemming 
	from the "hard-boiled" tradition.  Stories like "Johnny Mnemonic" and "Burning Chrome" best 
	exemplify this particular brand of story.  But Gibson also pulls a few surprizes out of his 
	hat and delivers stories that are highly experimental and center around character study rather 
	than high-tempo, action-packed adventure stories.  "The Winter Market" in particular struck me 
	as especially brilliant.  His focus in the story was not the neat gadgetry that was represented 
	by the "exoskeleton" worn by one of the characters, it was how this shaped this character and 
	effected her life.  But Gibson doesn't stop there, he gives us a cast of strong characters and 
	plenty of interaction between them.  And this is what really made the story interesting for me.  
	The sf elements are there, but the story has a great deal of universality in its portrayol of 
	real people in situations we can relate to.
</p>
<p>
	I also thought that "Hinterlands" and "The Gernsback Continuum" were very interesting stories.  
	"Hinterlands", like "The Winter Market", tells a real character oriented story, and  "The Gernsback
	Continuum" is unlike any other story I've ever read.  All of Gibson's stories are well written, but
	these stories in particular established his reputation in my mind.
