	This page is here to promote the idea that science fiction
	can be more than just the juvenile, escapist literature that it is often
	perceived to be. Science fiction's greatest achievements stand among the
	greatest works of the century. Nevertheless, there are very few science
	fiction novels that are recognized for their brilliance. The few that have
	achieved some mainstream recognition have done so more because of the author's
	reputation outside of the field, rather than on their on terms. While
	Gene Wolfe's <i>The Book of the New Sun</i> has as much to offer the careful
	reader as, say, <i>Ulysses</i> or<b> </b><i>Moby Dick</i>, its refusal
	to cater to a mainstream audience has kept it from gaining a wide-spread
	audience, or even a firm reputation in the academic world. Wolfe
	has written a true masterpiece, only to have this praise qualified as "a
	masterpiece <i>of science fiction</i>" as if this were all a great work
	of science fiction could possibly achieve. <i>The Book of the New
	Sun</i> is unapolagetically a work of pure <i>genre</i> science fiction,
	and this has undoubtedly led to its literary ghettoization.
</p>

<p>
	I use Wolfe's masterwork as an example, but the same could
	be said for many of science fictions greater achievements, including most
	of those listed below, in my "all time top ten" list.
</p>

<p>
	That said, here are my ten favorite science fiction books:

	<h2>Recent &amp; Recommended</h2>
	Every once in a while I will update this section with recently published
	books that I think readers of my self-defined version of literary science
	fiction would find interesting. Not all of these books are SF, but
	I try to limit myself to books that readers of SF (at least, the thinking
	man's SF) would enjoy.

<h4>Recessional</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
"What struck me on the beach--and it struck me indeed, so that I staggered as at
a blow--was that if the Eternal Principle had rested in that curved thorn I had
carried about my neck across so many leagues, and if it now rested in the new
thorn (perhaps the same thorn) I had only now put there, then it might rest in
everything, in every thorn in every bush, in every drop of water in the sea. The
thorn was a sacred Claw because all thorns were sacred Claws; the sand in my
boots was sacred sand because it came from a beach of sacred sand. The cenobites
treasured up the relics of the sannyasins because the sannyasins had approached
the Pancreator. But everything had approached and even touched the Pancreator,
because everything had dropped from his hand. Everything was a relic. All the
world was a relic. I drew off my boots, that had traveled with me so far, and
threw them into the waves that I might not walk shod on holy ground."
</p>
<p>
--<i>The Citadel of the Autarch</i>,
<a href="http://world.std.com/~pduggan/wolfe.html">Gene Wolfe</a>.
