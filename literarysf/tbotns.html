<p>
If science fiction will ever gain any sort of critical respect from the literary
canon, this is the type of book that would do it. Although many have compared
this book to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, I think it's a poor comparison. Sure,
it can be compared to Tolkien on the shallowest level, but it is much more akin
to Dickens, Joyce, Proust, Chesterton, and (especially) Borges. Not that I
dislike Tolkien, but he is overused as a comparison to provide any meaningful
context in which to judge a book.
</p>
<p>
This book could be read for countless lifetimes without exhausting its wealth.
On the surface its another stable boy becomes emporer sort of story (although a
neat twist is that the "stable boy" is actually--by profession--a torturer), but
wow...if any story can validate an entire genre, here it is. The imagery is also
decidedly beautiful. The story is set in an unspecified, but
<strong>extremely</strong> distant future...the moon has been made verdant and
now shines green in the sky...the Sun is dying due to "a worm" at its
center...the sands on the beach are full of colors because the sand is not
really sand, but the glass and stone from our buildings of today ground into a
fine powder...all the mountains have been carved to the shape of former
"autarchs"...the city in which the action starts is actually a former spaceport
and the towers of the city are spaceships....
</p>
<p>
I could go on and on. Most of these things are not explained directly in the
book. They are hinted at and must be pieced together from the clues strewn
about, and this makes the imagery that much more powerful. I cannot say enough
about this book. If you aren't convinced, read what John Clute has to say about
Wolfe, both in his books of essays, and in "The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction",
which rightly calls Wolfe the most important writer of science fiction in the
world today.
