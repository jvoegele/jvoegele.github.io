<h1>Science Fiction <i>vs.</i> Sci-Fi</h1>
<h3>Written SF and the Film Industry</h3>
by <a href="http://www.jvoegele.com">Jason Voegele</a>

<p>
Science Fiction:  "Fiction that imaginatively uses scientific fact and
speculation to create a fantastic situation." That's what Webster says, anyway.
</p>
<p>
Sci-Fi:  the term often used by the commonfolk to refer to those silly stories
about spaceships and monsters, even if most such stories are really about
something entirely different and probably not very silly at all.  Usually.
</p>
<p>
While writers of science fiction have recently (by which I mean the past thirty
years or so) moved away from what is perceived by the public to be "sci-fi",
writing much more about people than monsters, movies and television still dwell 
on themes exhausted by hacks in the fifties.  Consequently, those ignorant of
the genre still dismiss most works of sf as "that silly sci-fi stuff," while
those of us more informed cringe at that hideous neoligism.
</p>
<p>
So what good old Hollywood gives us is <i>Star Wars</i>, which isn't much more
than swords and sorcerers at FTL speeds, with X-wing fighters making U turns in
vacuum.  It gives us <i>Back to the Future</i>, in which a time travelling
DeLorean saves the day for a bunch of cardboard cutouts.  Television gives us a
new <i>Star Trek</i> clone every year, none of which offer us anything as far 
as originality or interesting variations from the original. Film gives us <i>The
Ice Pirates</i>, <i>Wierd Science</i>, and <i>Godzilla vs. Mothra</i>.  It gives
us sci-fi in all its silliness.  Hugo Gernsback would be proud!  Harlan Ellison
pretty much summed it up when he said "As fit subject matter for motion
pictures, science fiction and fantasy are a pair of dead ducks." (He of course
retracted this statement after seeing <i>Brazil</i>, which he promptly claimed
was one of the ten greatest motion pictures of all time, along with about
two-dozen others.)
</p>
<p>
While Hollywood garners all the big bucks for its sci-fi, it ignores whats
happening with written sf.  Recent sf writers are taking the best elements of
the Golden Age and the New Wave and creating something totally new and original,
and doing it with real skill, but movies are still doing sci-fi.  Movies have
ignored Gene Wolfe, Ursula LeGuin, William Gibson, Dan Simmons, and hoards of
others in favor of remakes of schlock.  Gems like <i>Bladerunner</i> come along
far too rarely.  We can only hope sci-fi will eventually mature into science
fiction.
