	<h1>Thoughts on Heinlein's <i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i></h1>

<hr>

<p>
	 I came into my reading of Robert Heinlein's novel, <I>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</I>, with rather high expectations.  Heinlein's esteemed 
	 reputation in the science fiction field is by itself justification to garner such exceedingly high expectations.  Aside from this 
	 though, I've heard from many sources that this is Heinlein's masterpiece, better even than his world-famous (although I think 
	 somewhat overrated) <I>Stranger in a Strange Land</I>.  In fact it was even voted to be the greatest of all sf books to ever win the hugo 
	 award, beating out Frank Herbert's <I>Dune</I>, the aforementioned <I>Stranger</I>, Ursula K. Le Guin's <I>The Left Hand of Darkness</I>, and Walter 
	 Miller's <I>A Canticle for Leibowitz</I>, respectively.  Hmm.  Seems to me that Heinlein has beat out some pretty stiff competition.  (As to 
	 the reputability of the voting audience, it is rather varied.  Harlan Ellison did very well in the short story category, winning 
	 three of the top five positions in that area, and Daniel Keye's also took a top prize.  But also among the top vote-getters were Anne 
	 McCaffrey and Isaac Asimov. But I digress.)
</p>	 
<p>
	 After reading the novel, however, I think it fails to live up to such an honor, and is, 
	 I believe, the inferior of the works of the other author's mentioned.  Not that it was a bad book, really.  Heinlein has done a 
	 masterful job of showing us how a revolution such as he describes might actually take place, and on this level I think the book is 
	 thoroughly believable and works very well.  His technical descriptions of life on the moon and the AI known as Mike show that 
	 Heinlein knows his stuff as far as science and, to a certain extent, sociology are concerned.  All this leads to a book that is both 
	 enjoyable and thought provoking.  Why, then, my disappointment?  Well, if you look at those other books which Heinlein's book beat 
	 out in the ballot (disregarding <I>Stranger</I>), they are books that are filled with humanity. They have something to say about <I>people</I>, 
	 both as individuals and societies.  They are, indeed, what we might call <I>literature</I>, or at least attempts at literature:  what we 
	 might call <I>serious</I> fiction.  You can probably understand now why I came away from the book a little disappointed.  I went in 
	 expecting a true piece of art (for how else could it be said to be better than, say, Le  Guin's novel?) and came out with the 
	 realization that this is nothing more than a good book (what a shame!).  It does have a few fresh insights, but nothing as far as 
	 symbolism or depth of characterization that we see in the other works.  It is what we might call popular fiction.  All in all, it was 
	 an enjoyable book, but not what I would call the greatest sf novel ever.
