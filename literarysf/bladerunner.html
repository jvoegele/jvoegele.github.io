	<p>
		The first important thing to realize about <i>Blade Runner</i> is that it is a science fiction
		film (or "speculative fiction", or if you prefer that hideous neologism "sci-fi"; well,
		how about just SF).  What most SF works seem not to realize is that a story probably
		should not be told as SF unless it <i>needs</i> to be.  Unlike <i>Star Wars</i>, which isn't
		much more than a western shoot-em-up with ray-guns and rocket-ships, <i>Blade Runner</i> tells
		a story that could only be told as SF.  This is because it is the SF elements of the film
		which are the focus of the story, and director Ridley Scott uses these elements to explore
		the wavering boundary between the real and the artificial.
	</p>
	<p>
		This boundary is examined--in true science-fictional form--by extrapolation.  With genetic
		engineering producing replicants which are identical to human beings in all respects
		except their lack of pre-defined emotional responses and superior physical strength (and
		perhaps intelligence), this boundary has become a fine line indeed.  Scott, and by extension
		Philip K. Dick who wrote the novel <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</i> on which the
		movie is based, forces us to ask ourselves just what "real" is (a common theme of Dick's work).
		The replicants are of course man-made, but does this mean they should be afforded fewer rights
		than "real" human beings?  Is this not just another form of discrimination based on characteristics
		beyond the person's ability (or even desire to) control?  Scott goes to great lengths
		to explore this question by introducing characters who do not know at first that they are
		replicant (Rachael) and also suggesting that even Deckard might also be a replicant.
		Deckard would probably have to reevaluate his feelings for replicants deserving full status as
		human beings and also his role in withholding those rights if he were to one day find out that
		he was indeed one of them.  Which leads to the question of exactly who the "real" people of this
		world are: emotionless, robot-like (presumed) humans like Deckard, or a replicant like Roy who,
		despite his inexperience of dealing with emotions and his occasional "questionable actions",
		ultimately understands the value of <i>life</i>, natural or artificial.  However blasphemous,
		how many of us could not empathize with Roy when he meets his creator and expresses his most
		basic desire (again, with a skewed emotional response):  "I want more life, fucker!"?
	</p>
	<p>
		Replicants are, in this film, creations of human beings, artificial intelligences to use the
		"sci-fi" clich&eacute;.  Some might argue that human beings are also the creation of another
		Creator, whil others would say we are the natural products of evolution.  Neither of these
		views, however, would really change who we are as people if confirmed, at least on an individual
		level.  Replicants too would probably feel that their ultimate origins do not matter much
		as far as their status as livings beings, just like us.
