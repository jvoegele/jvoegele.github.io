	<h1>My Thoughts on <i>2010</i></h1>
	by <a href="http://www.jvoegele.com">Jason Voegele</a>

<hr>

<p>
	My first reaction to <I>2010</I> was that it was a pretty good science fiction movie, at least compared 
	to the usual trash we see from the movies.  It was in fact a very competent film that paid close 
	attention to details (although we still here that impossible <B><I>WHOOOOOOSH</I></B> when a spaceship flies by) 
	and offered us a story that was actually about something.  However, the film was far from perfect.  
	What was most annoying was the complete lack of subtlety in the movie.  The ending was far too 
	literal to be very effective, with all its preachments about human civilization.  It leaves us with 
	a feeling of mundania (relatively) rather than the sense of profound awe with which we leave the 
	theatre after the final shot of <I>2001</I>'s floating fetus.
</p>
<p>
	It seems to me that <I>2010</I> fails to live up to the standards of  the previous space oddysey.  What it 
	gains in dynamics, it loses in importance, profundity, and artistic sensibility.  A sequel to something 
	as wondrous as <I>2001: A Space Oddysey</I> should not leave us with a sense of "earthbound", but should take 
	us on to new vistas of the imagination.  Instead, we hear about political squables and troubles with loved 
	ones.  This would work fine if we were given characters with real depth, but seems unimportant when  we 
	have flat characters laid against a  background cosmic in scale.  It also fails to answer the questions 
	left us in <I>2001</I> in a satisfying manner.  (Why did HAL go crazy and kill his entire crew?  Oh, that was 
	a little programming glitch we overlooked.  We'll make sure it doesn't happen again.)
</p>
<p>
	All this aside, the movie was quite finely crafted.  I mean, given the source material Peter Hyams still 
	managed to make an entertaing movie out of what could have been another so so sci-fi film.
